This past weekend I spent volunteering at [Cleveland Givecamp][cle-gc] and working on a new website for local non-profit [Heights Arts][heights-arts]. Going into it, I had no idea what to expect, but what a fantastic experience it turned out to be.

Friday was spent finishing early at work, and helping to prepare the workspace. Over 190 developers were going to be working for 18 non-profits, and space needed to be made. As people started arriving, it was a fantastic experience to get around and meet a diverse group of local devs.  At 5:30, the kickoff was to begin, and I anxiously awaited meeting my team. I was placed with a rag-tag group of adventurers, including two C# developers, a fantastic PM, and a current Ohio State student. Naturally, we decided upon Wordpress.

I arrived to a Thunderstorm around 9:30 the next morning, and got right down to work. Up until this point, I have had no experience with Wordpress, or really any CMS, whatshowever. As an individual who is in no way new to hackathons, the experience ended up being extremely refreshing. By the end of the day, we ended up throwing together a system that I know [Heights Arts][heights-arts] will be able to use for years. Saturday finished up with a last minute feature request, that with the help of fellow Lean Dog, Joel Byler, we managed to crush in no time. I spent the night meeting people, and sleeping my my fantastic Eno Hammock.

Sunday was great. Because the site had been essentially finished the day before, I spent a lot of time wandering around, and observing other teams. I also ate more on this day that I had the rest of the days. In the end, I feel like we handed off a product to be proud of. A weekend that is spent learning, making new friendships, and sleeping under the stars is a great weekend, and I wouldn't have had it any other way.

Bonus: My LOC for the weekend was capped out at: 8. Wordpress isn't all bad after all.

POST: [Heights Arts][heights-arts] is still finishing on adding content, so the site has yet to go live.  I will update this post when it finally does.
